About
-----

OWSI-Core is a versatile Java framework used to build business applications... and have fun doing it.

It is an ongoing effort and we continuously improve it and add new features. It has been used in production for several years now.

Apart from the framework, we also released a Maven archetype to start a new application: it's called the "Basic application".

This framework is developed by Smile http://www.smile.fr (formerly Open Wide - http://www.openwide.fr/).
